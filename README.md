### What is a container?

A container is a process or group of processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. It has its own file system, networking, etc. It is a process that is running on the host machine.

- Containers are not VMs
- Containers are not processes
- Containers are not files
- Containers are not directories

- Nginx (web server) is a container that runs on the host machine
    - https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/ (open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more)


Test: `curl localhost:8800` # Should return html

### Recommended VS Code extensions

- Docker (allows you to run docker commands from VS Code)
- Kubernetes (allows you to run kubectl commands from VS Code)
- Remote Development (allows you to run VS Code in a container)
    - use cases:
        - you don't want to install all the tools on your local machine
        - you want to use a different OS than your local machine
        - you want to use a different version of a tool than your local machine
- Remote SSH (allows you to run VS Code on a remote machine)
- Live Share (allows you to share your VS Code session with others)
